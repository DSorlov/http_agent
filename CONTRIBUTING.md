#### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicates
2. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss
3. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`

#### Code Guidelines

- **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Formatting**: Use `black` for code formatting:
  ```bash
  black custom_components/
  ```
- **Import Sorting**: Use `isort` for import organization:
  ```bash
  isort custom_components/
  ```
- **Linting**: Run `flake8` to check for issues:
  ```bash
  flake8 custom_components/ --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
  ```

#### Testing

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

1. **Code Quality Checks Pass**:
   ```bash
   black --check custom_components/
   isort --check-only custom_components/
   flake8 custom_components/ --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
   ```

2. **Python Syntax Validation**:
   ```bash
   python -m py_compile custom_components/http_agent/*.py
   ```

3. **API Tests Pass**:
   ```bash
   python3 test_api.py
   ```

4. **Integration Works**: Test in Home Assistant using the Docker environment

#### Translation Guidelines

If adding or modifying translations:

1. Always update `custom_components/http_agent/strings.json` first
2. Update all language files in `custom_components/http_agent/translations/`:
   - `en.json` (English)
   - `sv.json` (Swedish)
   - `da.json` (Danish)
   - `de.json` (German)
   - `fi.json` (Finnish)
   - `no.json` (Norwegian)
3. Ensure all files maintain the same key structure (203 keys)
4. Validate JSON syntax:
   ```bash
   python3 -m json.tool custom_components/http_agent/translations/LANGUAGE.json
   ```

#### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

- Add new config flow step for auth configuration

```
